# Ability Score

* To create an ability score for your character, roll 4 six-sided dice (4d6).
* Disregard the lowest die roll and total the three highest ones.
* The result is a number between 3 (horrible) and 18 (tremendous).
* The average ability score for the typical commoner is 10 or 11. But your character is not typical. The most common ability scores for player characters (PCs) are 12 and 13.
